Hello world ðŸ‘‹

My name is Charles Proust.  I'm a developer who likes to make cool stuff ! ðŸ¤“

I started my career working in the army for 3 years.

After this experience, I became a trainer for a supermarket group. 

Then, I became training manager for a computer software package.

After 12 years working in training and IT support, I decided to move into the world of development, which has long been a passion of mine.

That's why, I trained at Wild Code School to become a Web and Mobile Web developer.

I invite you to discover more by browsing through my portfolio.
